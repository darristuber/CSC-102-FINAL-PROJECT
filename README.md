# CSC-102-FINAL-PROJECT

The goal of this project is to capture, store, and display photos taken when motion is detected by the PIR sensor. When motion is detected in front and to the sides of the PIR motion sensor, a photo will be captured. The photo will be stored in a local folder and displayed on a GUI application with the date and time. The user will be able to look back at the images any time after they have been captured using the GUI. The GUI also allows the system to be turned on and off. 

This was a team final project for The Science of Computing 2 at The University of Tampa. 

First and final deliverable word documents are available.
